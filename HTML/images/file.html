      ACCESS FM the fundamentals of design. This has been my foundation for my work across various mediums.
      With a strong background in Landscape design and Digital Rendering, I am driven to explore new avenues of digital storytelling and push the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of digital interfaces.
      As an aspiring UX/UI designer, my passion for visual storytelling and dedication to mastering problem solving is my drive to creating a new lifestyle and career.
      I thrive on presenting and engaging with people, utilizing multiple communication channels to foster meaningful interactions.
      Outside of the design world, I find joy in exploring new places and immersing myself in different cultures.
      Armed with a film camera, I capture the essence of each city I visit, creating personal albums to cherish and share with friends.
      I am excited to leverage my diverse experiences and creative mindset to contribute to the dynamic field of UX/UI design and create captivating experiences for users.
